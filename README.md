# metronome

Recreation of a mechanical metronome using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is not meant to be a useful tool, there are plenty of better online metronomes out there like https://www.flutetunes.com/metronome/ or https://www.imusic-school.com/en/tools/online-metronome/, and countless metronome mobile apps. This was mostly an attempt to make something interactive on the web without the need for frameworks or dependencies.
